## **Functionalities and Usage of RNAGlass**
RNAGlass is designed to identify and quantity the transfered mRNA from root to scion (vice versa) in grafted plants. The basic idea is using the root (or scion) specific mutation as barcode to identify and quantify the expressed and transfered mRNAs.

## **Dependencies**

1. bwa (version **0.7.17** or later, require the **-o** option), which can be downloaded from https://github.com/lh3/bwa.
2. samtools (v1.0 or later), which can be downloaded from https://github.com/samtools.
3. Python 3.6 or later version
	+ pysam (https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam, v0.12 or later) is required to be installed.

## **Basic usage**

## **Ouptput**
A VCF file containing the candidate barcode snps will be generated.
